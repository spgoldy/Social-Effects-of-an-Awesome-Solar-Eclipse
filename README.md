# social_effects_of_an_awesome_solar_eclipse

Life is full of awe-inspiring things--things that blow your mind and make you say "wow!"--like viewing a stunning sunset, listening to an amazing song, or taking a bite out of a particularly delcious burrito. 
Research indicates that feeling awe can make people more humble, generous, and helpful toward other people. But, much of this research happens in laboratory environments, with small samples of people.
How might the impacts of something awe-inspirie transpire on a massive scale? If awe can promote goodness, what might the impact be of millions of people simultaneously experiencing awe?

I set out to test this by examining millions of tweets surrounding a massively awe-inspiring event: the 2017 total solar eclipse. 
This work was published in a recent scientific article (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976221085501).

Here, I outline how I gathered, cleaned, and analyzed this data.
